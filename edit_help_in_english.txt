Regular arrow keys seem to work. And number keys in number pad.

Might as well translate them all, as far I remember:

"n" = new item 

"y" = delete this

"e" = new item after eval

"l"= search

"p"=pretty print

"r"=remove parenthesis

"a"=add parenthesis

"w"=(list this next)

"s" = substitute

"b" = double this

"v" = switch this next

"z" = edit the value of a symbol

"c" = nconc this next

"f" = refresh

"k" = full copy of this

"q" = quote this

 "-" = exit

"h" = show numbers in hex
